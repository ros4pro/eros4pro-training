Move the Robot
==============

Now, move said robot out of the forbidden zone.

For this, write a ROS2 publisher that would publish code that would move the robot out of that area.

First, install the necessary dependency:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

For writing a ROS2 publisher, look into an example publisher in Python_ or in C++ here_ .

The tutorial also contains an example on how to write a subscriber. You will not need it for completing the task, but can complete it if curious.
