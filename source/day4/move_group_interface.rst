Before we start coding
----------------------
In this section we are going to learn how to program a manipulator robot using the MoveGroup C++ interface. For practicing how to program robot manipulators by using MoveGroup C++ interface, letâ€™s use the digital twin by launching the demo.launch. The following list of nuggets explain different ways we can program robot manipulators using MoveGroup C++ interface. All the example code solutions can be found in the repository for `movegroup_interface_demo <https://github.com/ut-ims-robotics/movegroup_interface_demo>`_. Clone it and build it.

The API refrence can be found `here <http://docs.ros.org/noetic/api/moveit_ros_planning_interface/html/classmoveit_1_1planning__interface_1_1MoveGroupInterface.html>`_

Keep in mind that in the example code, the execute function has been commented out for safety reasons. When working with a digital twin it is safe to uncomment the line.
